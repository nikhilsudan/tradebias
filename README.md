- Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)  
- Revenge Trading  
- Overtrading  

It helps traders understand patterns in their decisions and improve discipline.

## 🛠 Features  
- Bias detection from raw trade logs  
- Generate synthetic trade data for testing  
- Visualize results via Jupyter notebooks  
- Modular Python code for extensibility
